# Source code for eLife Manuscript
Babola TA, Kersbergen CJ, Wang HC, Bergles DE. Supporting cells in the cochlea reduce hair cell excitability by increasing the extracellar space. eLife, 2019.

Source code used for analyzing data and generating figures for eLife manuscript. Raw imaging data is excluded from this repository, but raw ROI signals obtained from those images and subsequent processing scripts are included here. 

## In vivo imaging pipeline
For widefield epifluorescence imaging, the script IC_SC_normalization was used. This allows a user to load an image (.tif or .czi) and select ROIs for IC and SC analysis. The output of these files was then used in subsequent analysis scripts located within each applicable folder.

## General functions
A set of general functions used across the multiple experiments is included in the MATLAB Functions folder.

## Analysis and scripts used for generating figures.
Each figure folder contains scripts used for analyzing data and plotting figures used in the paper. Figures were output in the .eps file format and imported into CorelDraw for final presentation.
